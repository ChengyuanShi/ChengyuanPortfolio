    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>


    <h2>
       My artworks contain Glitch art, Composite art, Sound art, Web art, and code art. They were produced by Audacity, Photoshop, Atom, and Premiere. These works are collectively referred to as digital media art, and I use these tools to make and share my ideas and my daily life.</h2>

  <h2> The first work is glitch art. I chose a photo I used to photograph and then echoed and glitched the image through Audacity. In the end, a great effect was formed. The second work is Composite art. Photoshop makes this. Gun control is the subject of my work. I combined and created the pictures I found on the Internet, and the final result was that the chef used a knife to cut a gun to express my thoughts. The third work is sound art. First, I recorded the sound around the school through the mobile phone recording function and then synthesized it through Audacity. The fourth work is video art. I use Pr to combine and affect the videos, which were I usually record. Video production was finally produced. The fifth work is web art. I created an interactive text webpage work through Atom and Github. I was inspired by Japanese word puzzle games. On my web page, different choices have different effects. The other two works were worked with the team, and they were made using P5, Github, and Atom.
